# Webhook Service - Status ✅

## Setup Complete

All webhook service configuration is complete and verified.

### ✅ Step 1: DNS Configuration
- DNS record `webhook.dlux.io` → `157.180.53.238` (configured by user)

### ✅ Step 2: Webhook Secret Set
- Secret generated and configured
- Secret stored in: `~/dlux-sui/services/webhook-service/.env` (not in git)
- Webhook service restarted successfully

### ✅ Step 3: GitHub Webhook Created
- Webhook ID: `591648637`
- Payload URL: `https://webhook.dlux.io/webhook`
- Events: `["push"]`
- Secret: Configured and verified
- Status: **Active**

### ✅ Verification
- Webhook ping test: **Successful**
- Service logs show ping event received
- Webhook service running via PM2: `webhook-service`

## Current Configuration

**GitHub Repository:** `disregardfiat/dlux-sui`  
**Webhook URL:** `https://webhook.dlux.io/webhook`  
**Webhook ID:** `591648637`  
**Service Port:** `3008` (PM2)  
**Events:** Push events to `main` branch

## How It Works

1. **Push to main branch** on GitHub
2. **GitHub sends webhook** to `https://webhook.dlux.io/webhook`
3. **Caddy routes** request to `localhost:3008`
4. **Webhook service**:
   - Verifies HMAC SHA-256 signature
   - Checks if push is to `main` branch
   - Pulls latest changes: `git pull origin main`
   - Executes deployment: `./deploy.sh`
   - Deployment script:
     - Installs dependencies for changed services
     - Builds TypeScript services
     - Restarts PM2 services

## Testing

### Test Webhook from GitHub

You can test the webhook by:

1. **Manual ping** (already done - successful):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/disregardfiat/dlux-sui/hooks/591648637/pings \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Make a commit and push**:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change
   echo "# Test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Test webhook deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check deployment logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs webhook-service
   pm2 list  # Verify services restarted
   ```

### Check Webhook Delivery Status

Visit: `https://github.com/disregardfiat/dlux-sui/settings/hooks/591648637/deliveries`

## Monitoring

### View Logs
```bash
pm2 logs webhook-service
pm2 logs webhook-service --lines 100  # Last 100 lines
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
pm2 status webhook-service
pm2 describe webhook-service
```

### Restart Service
```bash
pm2 restart webhook-service
```

## Security

- ✅ Webhook signatures verified using HMAC SHA-256
- ✅ Only pushes to `main` branch trigger deployment
- ✅ Secret stored securely in `.env` file (not in git)
- ✅ Invalid signatures return `401 Unauthorized`

## Troubleshooting

If webhook doesn't trigger deployment:

1. Check webhook delivery in GitHub settings
2. Check service logs: `pm2 logs webhook-service`
3. Verify secret matches: Check `.env` file and GitHub webhook settings
4. Test manually: `cd ~/dlux-sui && ./deploy.sh`

## Next Steps

- ✅ Webhook service: Configured
- ✅ GitHub webhook: Created and active
- ✅ DNS: Configured
- ✅ Deployment: Ready for automatic deployments

The webhook service is now fully operational and will automatically deploy changes when you push to the `main` branch! 🚀
